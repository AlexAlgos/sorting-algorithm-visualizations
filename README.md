# Sorting Algorithm Visualizations

Welcome to Sorting Algorithm Visualizations! I built this application to help myself and my classmates learn about the different sorting algorithms we learned from class through visualizations. I hope you enjoy spending time learning about the different sorting algorithms through the visualizations! You can access the visualizations here: https://alexalgos.github.io/sorting-algorithm-visualizations/

Note: Preferably best to access the website using Google Chrome.

## About the Algorithms

This application supports the following algorithms: 

**Merge Sort**: Is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It divides the input array into half, calls itself for the half, and then merges the two sorted halves. Best on large datasets.

**Quick Sort**: Is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as the pivot and partitions the array around the picked pivot.

**Bubble Sort**: Is a comparison based sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.

**Insertion Sort**: Is a sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.
